Graphics-Lab-Assignments
========================

Programming assignments to learn and practice the concepts taught in the theory course Computer Graphics.

Assignment 1
============
Using midpoint method design an efficient algorithm to scan convert a cubic spline curve expressed in the 
following parametric form:

x(u) = a0 + a1 * u + a2 * u^2 + a3 * u^3
y(u) = b0 + b1 * u + b2 * u^2 + b3 * u^3

where 0 <= u <= 1

Assignment 2
============
Given 2 ellipses X and Y use scan fill algorithm to color `X and Y` with RED and `X and not(Y)` with GREEN and `not(X) and Y` with YELLOW.
